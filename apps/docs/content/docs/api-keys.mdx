## TL;DR

- Generate keys in the dashboard Settings → API Keys
- Use either `Authorization: Bearer <key>` or `x-api-key: <key>`
- Scopes: `read:data`, `write:data`, `read:experiments`, `track:events`, `admin:apikeys`, `read:analytics`, `write:custom-sql`, `read:export`, `write:otel`, `admin:users`, `admin:organizations`, `admin:websites`, `rate:standard`, `rate:premium`, `rate:enterprise`
- Access can be global or scoped to a resource like a specific `website`
- For private websites, include `website_id` and ensure the key has `read:data`
- Rotate and revoke keys in the dashboard; only the prefix/start should be shared/logged

### What is an API key?

An API key authenticates server-to-server calls to Databuddy. It supports fine-grained scopes and optional resource scoping to enforce least-privilege access.

### Create a key

1. Open the dashboard → Settings → API Keys
2. Click “Create API Key”
3. Choose a name, optional organization, scopes, and resource access
4. Copy the secret immediately (it’s only shown once)

We only display the `prefix` and first characters (`start`) later for identification. Never share the full secret.

### Use your key

You can authenticate with either header:

<CodeBlock 
  language="bash"
  code={`curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \\
  "https://api.databuddy.cc/v1/websites/{website_id}/analytics"`}
/>

<CodeBlock 
  language="bash"
  code={`curl -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \\
  "https://api.databuddy.cc/v1/websites/{website_id}/analytics"`}
/>

Notes:

- For private websites, include the `website_id` query or path parameter and ensure the key has `read:data` for that site.
- For public websites, `website_id` may be optional depending on the endpoint semantics.

### Scopes

#### Data Access Scopes
- **read:data**: Basic read access to analytics data
- **write:data**: Write or modify analytics data (server-side ingestion)
- **read:analytics**: Advanced analytics access with custom queries and exports
- **read:export**: Access to data export functionality
- **write:custom-sql**: Execute custom SQL queries against analytics database

#### Feature-Specific Scopes
- **read:experiments**: Read A/B tests and feature flags
- **track:events**: Send tracking events and custom events
- **write:otel**: Authorize OpenTelemetry tracking and metrics

#### Administrative Scopes
- **admin:apikeys**: Create, update, rotate, revoke API keys
- **admin:users**: User management operations
- **admin:organizations**: Organization management operations
- **admin:websites**: Website management operations

#### Rate Limiting Scopes
- **rate:standard**: Standard rate limits (default)
- **rate:premium**: Higher rate limits for premium usage
- **rate:enterprise**: Enterprise-level rate limits

Grant only what you need. Prefer resource-scoped access where possible.

### Resource access

Access can be scoped to different resource types:

- **global**: Applies to all resources
- **website**: Applies to a specific website (use the `website_id` in requests)
- **analytics_data**: Analytics events and metrics data
- **error_data**: JavaScript errors and exceptions
- **web_vitals**: Core Web Vitals performance metrics
- **custom_events**: Custom event tracking data
- **export_data**: Data export operations

Example: a key with `read:data` on a single website can read analytics only for that website, not others. A key with `read:analytics` scoped to `analytics_data` can access detailed analytics but not error data.

### Errors

Authentication/authorization failures return structured errors:

<CodeBlock 
  language="json"
  code={`{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Authentication required",
  "code": "AUTH_REQUIRED"
}`}
/>

<CodeBlock 
  language="json"
  code={`{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Insufficient permissions",
  "code": "FORBIDDEN"
}`}
/>

### Rotation and revocation

- **Rotate** to generate a new secret for the same key (update your servers immediately)
- **Revoke** to immediately disable a key (cannot be undone; create a new one if needed)

Actions are available in the dashboard under each key’s detail view.

### Rate limits

All API endpoints are rate-limited. See the Rate Limits section in the API Reference. Responses include standard `X-RateLimit-*` headers where applicable.

### Audit Logging

All API key usage is logged for security and compliance:

- **Authentication events**: Successful and failed key usage
- **Scope resolution**: What permissions were checked and granted
- **Resource access**: Which data resources were accessed
- **Administrative actions**: Key creation, rotation, and revocation

Logs include IP addresses, user agents, and timestamps for security monitoring.

### Best practices

- Treat API keys like passwords; don't commit them to source control
- Use environment variables or secret managers
- Share only the prefix and `start` snippet for identification
- Use least-privilege scopes and resource scoping
- Rotate keys periodically and revoke unused keys
- Monitor audit logs for suspicious activity
- Use resource-scoped keys for better security
