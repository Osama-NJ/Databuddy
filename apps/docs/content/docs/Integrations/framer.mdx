# Framer Integration

Databuddy enables you to gather privacy-first analytics on user behavior, capture custom events, track performance metrics, and more within your Framer site - all while maintaining GDPR compliance without cookies.

## How to Add Databuddy to Framer

### 1. Get Your Tracking Script

Navigate to your [Databuddy dashboard](https://app.databuddy.cc) and copy your tracking code snippet:

```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.databuddy.cc/databuddy.js"
  data-site-id="YOUR_SITE_ID"
  async
></script>
```

### 2. Add the Script to Your Framer Project

1. Open your Framer project
2. Go to **Site Settings** > **General**
3. Scroll down to **Custom Code**
4. Paste your Databuddy snippet into the **Start of &lt;head&gt; tag** section
5. Click **Save** and publish your changes

### 3. Verify Installation

Once published, you can verify that Databuddy is working by:

1. Visiting your live Framer site
2. Opening your browser's developer tools (F12)
3. Checking the Console tab for a "Databuddy initialized" message
4. Visiting your Databuddy dashboard to see real-time analytics

## Advanced Features

### Custom Event Tracking

Track custom interactions in your Framer components using data attributes:

```html
<!-- Track button clicks -->
<button data-track="cta_clicked" data-button-type="primary">
  Get Started
</button>

<!-- Track form submissions -->
<form data-track="newsletter_signup" data-form-location="header">
  <!-- form content -->
</form>
```

### Performance Monitoring

Enable performance tracking by updating your script configuration:

```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.databuddy.cc/databuddy.js"
  data-site-id="YOUR_SITE_ID"
  data-track-performance="true"
  data-track-web-vitals="true"
  async
></script>
```

## Benefits for Framer Sites

- **Lightweight**: Only 3KB script size (247x smaller than Google Analytics)
- **Fast Loading**: Async loading won't slow down your Framer site
- **SEO Friendly**: Improves Core Web Vitals and page speed scores
- **Privacy Compliant**: No cookies required, fully GDPR/CCPA compliant
- **Real-time Data**: See visitor activity as it happens

## Troubleshooting

### Script Not Loading

If Databuddy isn't working:

1. Ensure the script is in the **Start of &lt;head&gt; tag** section
2. Check that your Site ID is correct
3. Verify your site is published (not just preview mode)
4. Check browser console for any error messages

### Data Not Appearing

If analytics data isn't showing:

1. Wait 2-3 minutes for data processing
2. Check that your domain is verified in Databuddy dashboard
3. Ensure you're viewing the correct date range
4. Try visiting your site in an incognito window
